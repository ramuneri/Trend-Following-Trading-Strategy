# Trend-Following Trading Strategy in Python

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation, simulation, and optimization of a **trend-following** trading strategy using Python.  
The strategy uses **moving average crossovers** to generate buy and sell signals, includes **take profit and stop loss mechanisms**, accounts for **transaction costs**, and evaluates performance through an equity curve and Sharpe ratio optimization.

## Features

- Trend-following strategy based on moving averages
- Buy/sell signals with annotations on price charts
- Take profit and stop loss for risk management
- Transaction costs included in profit calculations
- Parameter optimization using brute-force or random search
- Performance evaluation with equity curve and Sharpe ratio

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- yfinance

## Strategy

##### IF short_MA > long_MA â†’ we are in an uptrend â†’ buy or hold

- The short MA is above the long MA, meaning recent prices are higher than older prices.
- This signals momentum upward â€” trend-following strategy assumes the price will continue rising.
  Actions:
- If you are not in a position â†’ buy
- If you are already holding â†’ do nothing (hold)

##### IF short_MA < long_MA â†’ we are in a downtrend â†’ sell or stay out

- The short MA is below the long MA, meaning recent prices are lower than older prices.
- This signals momentum downward â€” the trend is falling.

##### Actions:

- If you are holding â†’ sell to avoid losses
- If you are not holding â†’ stay out

##### Portfolio price changes

ðŸ”¼ Buy â†’ sharp jump (cash â†’ stock)
ðŸ“ˆ Hold â†’ wiggly line (portfolio follows price)
ðŸ”½ Sell â†’ sharp drop (stock â†’ cash)
â€” Flat â†’ straight line (holding cash)
